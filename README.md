## Description
A simple drawing program that allows you to make pixel art. I used pygame 
to create the program. I have added files for different types of pixel art
donuts to add to the screen as well. 

It uses random to pick at random which donut you will get each time the 
program opens. You can also add circles and change their colors using the 
keyboard. There is a full screen option as well as a way to change the color
of the screen between dark and light mode. 

In the future I would like to be able to change each individual circle and pixel 
color. I would also like to add a better way to change the donuts while the 
program is running.

Overall it is just a fun little program to help me synthesize what I have 
learned this semester and I really enjoyed making it.

# Usage
- click mouse to add a pixel to the drawing pad
- press "c" to add a circle
- press "d" to add a pixel art donut
- the numbers 1-5 change the color of the circles
- press "f" to toggle to full screen
- press "w" to change screen color to off white
- press "b" to change the screen color back to black
